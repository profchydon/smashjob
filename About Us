Nkwocha Chidi Callistus started SMASHJOB because of a well known gap between job seekers who constantly seeks for 
suitable jobs and employers who constantly need the right, suitable and qualified employees for their company.

That's why he created a website where Employers and Recruiters can advertise their Job vacancies, check reports and filter applicants/applications.
Job seekers can also check for jobs and also upload their CVs so they can apply for different jobs simultaneously.

A website that will serve as the top online destination where employees can look for jobs that fit their profile, 
and employers can also look out for the job seekers that best fits their vacancy thereby helping to bridge the gap 
between employer and job seeker by saving time and money as the site and its features can be accessed in real time and for FREE.

We want to be a conduit, a final destination for job seekers and employers. We want to be a part of
a new generation of success stories. We also hope to go into consulting in terms of human resources.
